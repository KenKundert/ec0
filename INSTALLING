Introducing ec0
===============
This is ec0, a version of ec that is provided for use with older versions of 
python. The normal version of ec requires python 2.6 or later and the docutils 
package. ec0 has been tested to work on python 2.3 or later and does not require 
docutils.  If you have a choice, it is recommended that you used the normal 
version of ec.  That version more likely to be updated and enhanced. If you 
don't have a recent version of python, you can install it from source (not as 
difficult as it sounds, directions are given below).  However, if that is not 
your thing; ec0 is the version for you (once installed, it masquerades as ec).

ec0 is available from https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0.
ec is available from https://github.com/KenKundert/ec.

To download ec0, use either:
    $ git clone git://github.com/KenKundert/ec0.git
Using git allows you to get updates using:
    $ git pull
Alternatively, you can download the source as a tar or zip file by visiting
https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0/downloads or by running:
    $ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0/tarball/master
    $ tar zxf master
    $ rm -rf master ec0
    $ mv KenKundert-ec0-* ec0

Once you have your copy of ec0, test it with
    $ ./test
Be aware that some features are not available with earlier versions of Python, 
and as a result, several of the tests will fail. I hope to resolve this issue in 
subsequent releases.

You can install it using
    $ ./install
It will install the program into ~/.local (this occasionally fails due to a time
out, if this happens simply try again).  Both the program and a man page are 
installed. You do not need root access to install into ~/.local, but in doing so 
it is only easily accessible by you and you will need to add ~/.local/bin
to your PATH. Alternatively, you can edit ./install and remove the '--user' 
option.  That will cause EC to be installed so that it is accessible to all 
users without having to change their PATH, but it requires that you be root when 
you run the ./install command.

The functionality of ec0 will vary slightly based on the version of python you 
are using. Older versions have less functionality.
