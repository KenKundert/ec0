Introducing ec0
===============
This is ec0, a version of ec that is provided for use with older versions of 
python. The normal version of ec requires python 2.6 or later and the docutils 
package. ec0 has been tested to work on python 2.3 or later and does not require 
docutils.  If you have a choice, it is recommended that you used the normal 
version of ec.  That version more likely to be updated and enhanced. If you 
don't have a recent version of python, you can install it from source (not as 
difficult as it sounds, directions are given below).  However, if that is not 
your thing; ec0 is the version for you (once installed, it masquerades as ec).

ec0 is available from https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0.
ec is available from https://github.com/KenKundert/ec.

To download ec0, use either:
    $ git clone git@github.com:KenKundert/ec0.git
Using git allows you to get updates using:
    $ git pull
Alternatively, you can download the source as a tar or zip file by visiting
https://github.com/KenKundert/ec0/downloads.

Once you have your copy of ec0, test it with
    $ ./test
All tests should pass. Then you can install it using
    $ ./install
It will install the program into ~/local unless you change the install script.  
Both the program and a man page are installed.

The functionality of ec0 will vary slightly based on the version of python you 
are using. Older versions have less functionality.
